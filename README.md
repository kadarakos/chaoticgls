Reimplementing [A Novel Chaos Theory Inspired Neuronal Architecture"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12601.pdf).   

Haven't implemented the small training set regime yet, just focusing on standard cross-validation.
So far on Iris I've got the best result with macro averaged F1-score of 0.93 with ```q = 0.59``` and ```b = 0.9```.
